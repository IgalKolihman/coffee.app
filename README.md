# Coffee Machine

This is an app that's designed to check your testing skills.

# Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone ______________
```

Make sure that you have **Python** installed on your machine.
It doesn't matter which version of python.

# Running
## Linux - Recommended
Make sure that you are inside the coffee app repository.
```bash
cd coffee.app
```

Run the following command
```bash
./build/linux/x64/release/bundle/linux_desktop
```

## Web - WIP
Go into the web build directory
```bash

Then run an HTTP server in that directory. Usually, the `SimpleHTTPServer` module
comes already installed with python.

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Open your browser (Chrome is recommended) on the following URL:
